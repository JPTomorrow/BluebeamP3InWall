@TODO:

- Finish mc functionality
- Implement strut hangers
- Need to take the Fire Alarm name out of the conduit markups to make them work for both P3 and Fire Alarm

- DONE!!!! No ¼” all thread shown. Need all thread for supporting boxes and conduit. Need to add that.
- DONE!!!! Conduit needs to be listed as Red EMT. 
- Need blank covers shown as Red per every box.
- What are the nuts and washers for? Supporting the boxes? If so what assembly do you have per OVH box. We don’t need any nut or washer for the conduit runs if we use the Hilti shoot up anchor and the K-12.
- Add helicopter bracket per ovh box to support conduit coming in and out of the box. 
- If we come in and out of the top of the box instead of the side of the box then add a Caddy 4Z34812M. Kenneth are there any locations that we turn down into the top of the box?
